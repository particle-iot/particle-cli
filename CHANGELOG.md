* Fix `leave` being left off the DFU command when flashing user application firmware.
* Remove excess `console.log`
* Fix system version display during `identify` for Electrons

## 1.9.0 - 14 Jan 2016

### New Features

* `keys address` command to read protocol, host, and port configured on a device for the cloud.
* `keys protocol` command to switch cloud transport protocol between `tcp` and `udp` for devices that support it.
* `binary inspect` command to parse a firmware binary and output module information.
* `serial inspect` command to read module information from the device, parse, and display it. ([#76](https://github.com/spark/particle-cli/issues/76))
* `list` output can now be filtered using `online`, `offline`, device type, or device id/name. ([#96](https://github.com/spark/particle-cli/issues/96))
* Firmware binaries are now parsed and sent to the correct device address. This allows you to flash system parts with `flash --usb` now. Incorrect usage is prevented, but can be overridden with `--force`. ([#159](https://github.com/spark/particle-cli/issues/159))
* Check for updates - particle-cli now checks to see if you have the latest version from npm, at most once a day, and outputs a message if not.([#138](https://github.com/spark/particle-cli/issues/138))
* Cloud public keys are included and can be flashed by invoking `keys server` with no arguments. ([#70](https://github.com/spark/particle-cli/issues/70))
* Support across the board for ECC keys used with the UDP cloud protocol on the Electron. Most `keys` commands now support `--protocol udp` and `--protocol tcp`, but will default to what is appropriate for the device.

### Enhancements

* Add system firmware version to `identify` command. ([#95](https://github.com/spark/particle-cli/issues/95))
* Improve bad token handling. ([#193](https://github.com/spark/particle-cli/issues/193))

* Use device attributes to determine platform for flashing apps. ([#151](https://github.com/spark/particle-cli/issues/151))
* Output detected Wi-Fi security type. ([#126](https://github.com/spark/particle-cli/issues/126))
* Add option for manual entry if no Wi-Fi networks are detected. ([#121](https://github.com/spark/particle-cli/issues/121))
* Add `webhook` documentation to README. ([#29](https://github.com/spark/particle-cli/issues/29))
* Add support for `--product_id` to `keys send` command. ([#155](https://github.com/spark/particle-cli/issues/155))
* Improve API error handling.
* Improve device claiming output. ([#152](https://github.com/spark/particle-cli/issues/152))

### Fixes

* Fix URL for DFU install instructions. ([#191](https://github.com/spark/particle-cli/issues/191))
* Check arguments for `udp send`, `token revoke`. ([#185](https://github.com/spark/particle-cli/issues/185), [#180](https://github.com/spark/particle-cli/issues/180))
* Backspace will no longer erase console output. ([#20](https://github.com/spark/particle-cli/issues/20))
* Handle errors from `softap-setup-js` during `setup`. ([#154](https://github.com/spark/particle-cli/issues/154))
* Filter Photon SSIDs from available list during `serial wifi`. ([#135](https://github.com/spark/particle-cli/issues/135))
* Filter directories from list of files to compile during `compile`. ([#177](https://github.com/spark/particle-cli/issues/177))

* Okay! The command structure got a bit of a remodel, use ```spark help``` to see the new commands. Pro-Tip!  If you don't like the new command structure, the old commands should still mostly work, and you can remove the new commands entirely by adding ```commandMappings: null``` to your settings overrides file (which is here: ~/.spark/spark.config.json ).  There have also been lots of small bug fixes and improvements. Also, the new mappings.json file paves the way for language support for command descriptions and help in languages other than english.  Please feel free to send in translations! :)
