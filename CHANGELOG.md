05/27/2014 - 0.3.2 - Okay! The command structure got a bit of a remodel, use ```spark help``` to see the new commands.
  Pro-Tip!  If you don't like the new command structure, the old commands should still mostly work, and you
  can remove the new commands entirely by adding ```commandMappings: null``` to your settings overrides file
  (which is here: ~/.spark/spark.config.json ).  There have also been lots of small bug fixes and improvements.
  Also, the new mappings.json file paves the way for language support for command descriptions and help in languages
  other than english.  Please feel free to send in translations! :)
